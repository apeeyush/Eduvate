Eduvate
=======

It is an educational app to help children master a language faster. It randomly chooses a word from database and displays it in the form of flash cards on the screen.
It allows users to record their pronunciation which is assessed using tools like Google Speech2Text API and 
Chromaprint library for audio fingerprinting.
The user can also listen to the correct pronunciation of that word from our database directly from the web app interface.

The app can be tested [Here](http://eduvate.herokuapp.com/).

###Dependencies

The web app uses some of the chrome's inbuilt functionality and is therefore best used with chrome.
